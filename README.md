# MobGLM

We developed MobGLM, a novel mobility generation model based on LLMs and logit adjustment, designed to explore mobility patterns at both the macro level of people flow and the micro level of individual users. Extensive experiments conducted in the Tokyo metropolitan area demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms baseline models by an average of 5.02% across 4 evaluate metrics. We also validated the spatial distribution of the generated mobility within administrative regions, providing visualizations and similarity results to demonstrate the interpretability in predicting human behavior patterns. In future work, we plan to apply the generated mobility data to various downstream tasks, including logistics and pedestrian management, while exploring the generalizability of MobGLM to international urban environments.
